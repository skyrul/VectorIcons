# A small demo on using icons in react-native

This is an app to demonstrate the use of MaterialIcons, Fontawesome, etc. in it's usage in projects. ðŸ˜·

Has some examples on how to implement the icons into react native apps, and this runs on both iOS and Android.
I can also do the icons inside a button, all thanks to [react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons)! ðŸš€

## How?

VectorIcons uses [react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons) to display a 
icons such as MaterialIcons, Fontawesome, Entypo, etc.

Using the react native ionicons [react-native-ionicons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-ionicons) and the
[react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons) packages, we can implement icons 
and 
icons in buttons.
